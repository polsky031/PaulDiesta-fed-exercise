## i will submit whatever i finish in 4 hours

## i first check the possible packages that can be use on this project.

## read the readMe file and business rules.

## i started running the server, and test it via postman to check the response that i will be getting.

## the API result having complex object is still pretty straight forward to understand.

## then i started working on the frontend side, install packages and run the project.

## basically the project doesn't need to handle routing, so redux or flux is remove the context.

## i started building the header and body with approriate sass properties on it.

## then i tried fetching datas from the API given, with the use of componentDidMount property, and it was a success.

# you may notice on my code that i created function on rendering elemenet with those data coming from the API -> renderLaunchPad, renderYearDate, renderMissionDetails for easy debugging in the future.

# i completely display the 49 result set from the API as default based on the business rules.

# i did display if the mission is failed or not.

# i did use of Promise to handle the API given.

## what i didnt finish is the filtering part, i got so sleepy for starting the exam very late.


## thank you.
